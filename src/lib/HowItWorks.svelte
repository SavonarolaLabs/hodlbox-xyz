				Dear Hackathon Committee,<br /><br />

				We are excited to present our ErgoHack project, HodlBox. This dApp is designed to encourage
				long-term investment in the Ergo ecosystem. Our project addresses a common challenge in
				crypto: holding onto your coins over an extended period of time and not selling the bottom.
				To combat this, we've devised a non-custodial vault that allows users to stash their ERG
				until a specific time or price point is reached on Spectrum DEX. When a user purchases a
				Hodl Box, they will also receive a commemorative NFT as a token of their commitment. The
				NFTs become increasingly awesome with larger sums, adding a fun way for users to flex on
				social media.<br /><br />

				Our project is open-source, welcoming UI competition and abiding by Ergoâ€™s open source
				ethos. It's designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to mint in just two clicks.The Hodl
				Box system is secure and risk-free. Only the person who locked the box can unlock it, either
				when a certain price point is reached or after the established time period. The NFTs serve
				as a fun reward and Proof of Hodl, but they are not connected to the redemption process,
				eliminating the risk of losing access to your Hodl Box.<br /><br />

				We've implemented a small fee structure (0.5% contract, 0.5% UI) to support the project's
				sustainability. Importantly, the developers hold as well, with fees only paid after the hodl
				period, aligning the incentives of the ecosystem, users, and developers.<br /><br />

				In conclusion, our project offers a perfect financial tool for the coming bull market,
				encouraging long-term investment and increasing the TVL in the Ergo ecosystem. We look
				forward to sharing our website and contract with you soon.<br /><br />

				Best Regards,<br /><br />

				TMR.ERG, c8, savonarola
